I am a first-year PhD student in the [statistics department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. My current research has a number of directions: causal inference and optimal transport, estimation of dynamical systems from data, and developing statistical methodology for scRNA-seq data. I am also interested in signal processing and applications of statistics to music technology.

Before Berkeley, I studied at MIT and graduated with a bachelor's in mathematics with computer science and a minor in literature. There I had the great fortune to research with [Philippe Rigollet](http://www-math.mit.edu/~rigollet/) and [Florian Gunsilius](https://www.floriangunsilius.com/). Our paper introducing an optimal transport-based causal inference metholodology can be found [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05858.pdf). I also learned tremendously from research experiences in [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Division of Digital Psychitary](https://www.digitalpsych.org/) and MIT's [System Architecture Group](http://systemarchitect.mit.edu/).
