abstract: Increasingly scRNA-Seq studies explore the heterogeneity of cell populations across different samples and its effect on an organism's phenotype. However, relatively few bioinformatic methods have been developed which adequately address the variation between samples for such population-level analyses. We propose a framework for representing the entire single-cell profile of a sample, which we call its GloScope representation. We implement GloScope on scRNA-Seq datasets from study designs ranging from 12 to over 300 samples. These examples demonstrate how GloScope allows researchers to perform essential bioinformatic tasks at the sample-level, in particular visualization and quality control assessment.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper introduces methodology which directly accounts for sample-level variation in scRNA-Seq studies.
